# INCEPTION.JS 

INCEPTION.JS is a collaborative project organization used for building and iterating on software solutions across hackathons and innovation challenges.

It serves as a shared workspace to manage repositories, coordinate development, track experimentation, and maintain clear documentation.

Each repository represents an independent component or prototype developed as part of a larger solution.
